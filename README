This is an extension for Tk800.014 and upper which supplies TIFF
format loader for Photo image type. The TIFF code is stolen from
imgTIFF.c from the img1.2b2 distribution by Jan Nijtmans. Use
Tk-TIFF-0.01 for a Tk40*.* version.

Installation:

You need libtiff (http://www.libtiff.org/ or
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/) and probably libjpeg
(ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/) installed on your system.

Check Makefile.PL for configuration variables at the top and
appropriate library and include paths. Then build the extension by
typing:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The module is only tested with the following configurations:

* FreeBSD-4.4, perl 5.005_03, Tk 800.023, tiff 3.5.4, jpeg 6b
* FreeBSD-4.4, perl 5.7.2, Tk 800.023, tiff 3.5.4, jpeg 6b

Previous versions worked with other Linux and FreeBSD configurations.
I expect that there are no more endian problems, so this module will
also work on Sun Sparcs and other machines.

For AIX, I got reports that you have to manually add -lm and -lgcc to
the @libs variable in Makefile.PL.
