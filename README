This is an extension for Tk800.014 which supplies TIFF format loader
for Photo image type. The TIFF code is stolen from imgTIFF.c from the
img1.2b2 distribution by Jan Nijtmans. Use Tk-TIFF-0.01 for a Tk40*.*
version.

Installation:

You need libtiff (http://www.libtiff.org/ or
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/) and probably libjpeg
(ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/) installed on your system.

Check Makefile.PL for configuration variables at the top and
appropriate library and include paths. Then build the extension by
typing:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The module is only tested with the following configurations:

* FreeBSD-3.3, perl 5.005_03, Tk 800.015, tiff 3.5.1, jpeg 6b
* Linux 2.2.10 (Suse 6.2), perl 5.005_03, Tk 800.014, tiff 3.4, jpeg 6b

Previous versions worked with other Linux and FreeBSD configurations.
I expect that there are no more endian problems, so this module will
also work on Sun Sparcs and other machines.
