This is an extension for Tk800.014 which supplies TIFF format loader
for Photo image type. The TIFF code is stolen from imgTIFF.c from the
img1.2b2 distribution by Jan Nijtmans. Use Tk-TIFF-0.01 for a Tk40*.*
version.

Installation:

You need libtiff (ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/) and probably libjpeg
(ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/) installed on your system.

Check Makefile.pl for appropriate library and include paths and
library names. Then build the extension by typing:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The module is only tested with the following configurations:

* FreeBSD-2.2.8, perl 5.005_02, Tk 800.014, tiff 3.4, jpeg 6b
* Linux 2.0.34 (RedHat 5.1), perl 5.005_03, Tk 800.014, tiff 3.4, jpeg 6b

The previous version (0.02), and maybe this version too, worked with
following configurations:

* FreeBSD-2.2.7, perl 5.005_02, Tk 800.012, tiff 3.4, jpeg 6a
* FreeBSD-2.2.1, perl 5.004_04, Tk 800.005, tiff 3.4, jpeg 6a
* Linux 2.0.36 (RedHat 5.2), perl 5.005_54, Tk 800.012, tiff 3.4, jpeg 6b
